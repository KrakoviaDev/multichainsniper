# ü§ñ Sniper Bot

### ‚öôÔ∏è How it works
The bot continually sends requests to [Solana].<br>
If the token is available to purchase, the transaction will execute quickly.<br>
Please note that only tokens with sufficient liquidity and on-chain metadata are listed in Jupiter API: min. 250$ liquidity and buy/sell price impact are below 30%.<br>
When these criteria are met, it will take a few minutes to automatically add the token.<br>

### üÜï Add a token to snipe
- Add as many wallets as necessary
- Token/Project name
- Token Address
- Amount ($) to buy
- Take Profit ($)
- Stop Loss ($)
- Slippage (%)

If token has a launch date:
- Month
- Day
- Hours
- Minutes

### üî≠ Watch token
You can watch your trading position by selecting the token.<br>

### ‚úçüèª Edit tokens
You can modify token info as follow:
- Name
- Address
- Selected Wallet
- Buy Amount
- Take Profit
- Stop Loss
- Slippage
- Launch date
- Delete

# Q&A
### Where are my private keys?
*Your private keys are stored in `wallets.json`.*
### Is there any fees when swapping using the bot?
*There are no additional fees when performing swaps via the CLI; the costs should be the same as using the Jupiter UI.*
### Does sniper bot remains running if I close it?
*If you close the terminal, the sniper bot will stop running.*
